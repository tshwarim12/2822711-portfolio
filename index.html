            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Greetings, <br>
                I am Tshwaragano Montshioa, currently Final year Bsc Computer Science student at the University of Witwatersrand. I am young girl from Mahikeng, North West who has always
                 been interested in computers which led to me choosing CAT as subject in grade 10 which became one of my favourite subject in high school and it led me to choose the degree I'm currently persuing.
                I am interested in learning more about Software design as I aspire to be either a Software engineer or Data Scientist. I would be really glad to utilize the skills I'm 
                learning as of yet in the workplace as well as meeting and collaborating with other people in the same space.</p>

            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>I'm currently working on a project for Amazon, revamping their website, ensuring efficient shopping for users, we would like for customers to give their reviews on products 
                they've purchased to help other customers have an idea of what they're buying as well as add more payment options such as "pay just now", "apple/samsung/google pay" to avoid
                 customers having to put card numbers ensuring purchases without any hustle as we all know most of us have no idea where our cards are. </p>
